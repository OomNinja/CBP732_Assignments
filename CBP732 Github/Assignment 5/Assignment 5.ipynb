    "A research article with the title: \"Valorization of spent sulphite liquor for succinic acid production via continuous fermentation system\" by Ladakis et. al. (2018) was studied and its data analyzed. It compared metabolic yields, productivities and titres (YPTs) of AS and BS metabolites on both xylose and spent sulphite liquor (SSL) as substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two organisms were independantly evaluated metabolically and on their industrial applicability. Xylose was used as model substrate. Metabolic flux analysis and mass balance (black box) analysis was employed. The article data was used primarily as product rate specifications. An energy balance was done following the flux model and not included as an equation for solving the system.\n",

    "Flux r$_{16}$ was specified as zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CO$_2$ rate calculated by the flux model does not exactly match the CO$_2$ rate calculated by the mass balance as there are a number of streams producing/consuming CO$_2$ that were specified as zero as not enough specifications were available to fully solve the system. Additional streams concerning CO$_2$ that were neglected are r$_{13}$, r$_{19}$, r$_{20}$ and r$_{21}$. These streams were individually left unspecified (by rather specifying r$_{17}$ as zero) to test if this would have an influence on the CO$_2$ rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By unspecifying r$_{20}$, both r$_{18}$ and r$_{20}$ have realistic values, but in the opposite direction that is expected. It is expected that this occurs due to r$_{20}$ then consuming more NADH and CO$_2$ if utilized in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By unspecifying r$_{21}$, both r$_{18}$ and r$_{21}$ have unrealistically high values, but in the expected direction. Both have values above 1 $\\times \\ 10^{15}$ and are relatd by r$_{18}$/r$_{21}$ $ = \\ 1.333$. This is because there is only a carbon constraint keeping these streams in check (no NADH from either), therfore they could have any numerical value as long as the relationship between the two is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "By unspecifying r$_{19}$, the result was a singular matrix. Fluxes r$_{18}$ and r$_{19}$ are treated as the same stream in the model (as ATP is calculated afterwards and not used to solve the system) and, therefore, two identical equations exist to solve for two unidentical unknowns.\n",
